---

Create a conda environment for pVACtools: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
<pre>conda create --name pvactools
conda activate pvactools
conda install ipykernel</pre>
---

Install pVACtools in your environment following the instructions on: https://pvactools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

---

After all the installations, download the pVACDome.ipynb and open Jupyter Notebook
<pre>jupyter notebook</pre>
